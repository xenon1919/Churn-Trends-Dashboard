# Churn Analysis Project

## Description
This project focuses on customer churn analysis using SQL and Power BI. The data was imported into Power BI via Excel for visualization and insights. The objective is to identify factors contributing to customer churn and provide actionable insights for business improvements.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**: Utilized to query and manage the database.
- **Excel**: Used solely for data import into Power BI.
- **Power BI**: Leveraged for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## Project Files
- **[Churn Analysis.pbix](./Churn%20Analysis.pbix)**: Contains the Power BI report and dashboards.
- **[ChurnDB.sql](./ChurnDB.sql)**: Includes SQL scripts for database creation and queries.
- **Dataset [Customer_Data.csv](./Customer_Data.csv)**: This repository will also include the dataset used for the analysis.
